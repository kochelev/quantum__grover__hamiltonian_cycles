# quantum__grover_hamiltonian_path
Repository contains script that searches hamiltonian paths in the graph using quantum Grover algorithm.

Supposed you already have Python3 and Jupyter installed. Open Terminal, create a virtual environment and install requirements:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or use next command to install libraries without virtualenv:

```shell
> pip install numpy qiskit matplotlib
```

Than run notebook cell by cell.
